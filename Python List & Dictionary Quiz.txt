In your own words. I want to know how deep your knowledge is about the two components in Python
1
What is the difference between list and dictionary?
2
Which do you prefer and why?
3
What area does list solve that dictionary doesn't and vice versa
4
How many elements are in m if m = [[x, y] for x in range(0, 4) for y in range(0, 4)]
5
How do you get all keys in a dictionary?
6
How do you get all values in a dictionary?
7
How do you remove last object from a list?
8
How do you compare 2 lists?
9
How do you remove duplicate values in a list?
10
What is Dict and List comprehensions are?


1. Dictionary are like lists that have no order and have keys instead of indices.
2. Dictionary because they are more flexible than lists.
3. Dictionary can be used if you need a specific key to get the value for example assigning a number to a name in a contact list while lists are good for elements that needs to be in a specific order or doesn't need to be assigned to a specific value.
4. 16
5.for key in dictionary:
	return key
6.for key in dictionary:
	return dictionary[key]
7.list=list[:-1]
8. print (True if list_a==list+b else True)
9. 	output=[]
	for element in list:
    	  output.append(element) if not(element in output) else 1
           print output
10. Dictionary and list comprehensions are constructors that you can use if you need a list or dictionary and you have a simple algorithm that you can follow to determine the elements that you need.
